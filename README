This is a plugin for Icy (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org) that equalizes the
histogram of an image. This operation is also called "histogram flattening".
It operates on the selected channel of each image of a sequence.
Pixel intensities are transformed so that they are uniformly distributed over
the gray-scale range.
